<title>Abstract</title>
<p id="_497eb1d7-c4ca-4c80-d749-fb7188efa7b1">POI-CM is an open conceptual data model for representing information about points of interest (POI). It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) conceptual model standards for spatial and temporal data. Building on the ISO foundation assures that the features described in the POI Models share the same spatial-temporal universe as described by related standards (e.g., CityGML).</p>

<p id="_293d61e8-4696-fe49-c0ab-fadc793ab447">The aim of developing the OGC POI conceptual model is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of “points of interest.” In the broadest terms, a point of interest is a location about which information of general interest is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier, or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in various languages, information about open and closed hours, and a civic address.</p>

<p id="_48ee43bd-1142-53b7-5a7b-de06930a4a6e">This Users Guide provides extended explanations and examples for the individual concepts that are defined in the POI Conceptual Model Standard. Both the Conceptual Model Standard and this Users Guide are mutually linked to facilitate navigation between corresponding sections in these documents.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p id="_c2478c2e-ffa2-a9ff-f1e4-600335204190">There are many systems and applications that need to have information about locations in the world. For example, such “point of interest” (POI) data is needed in navigation systems, mapping, geocaching, location-based social networking games, and augmented reality browsers, among many others.</p>

<p id="_dcd98b43-9cc8-e37b-4d9f-c0abde52b930">POI data has traditionally been exchanged in proprietary formats by various transport mechanisms. This specification defines a flexible, lightweight, extensible POI data model. This will enable content publishers to effectively describe and efficiently serve and exchange POI data.</p>

<p id="_abbb411b-2114-107e-aa05-7d066dfdfbef">POI-CM is a common semantic information model for the representation of POI objects that can be shared across many use cases. The ability for a POI using this conceptual model to be shared and reused is especially important with respect to the cost-effective sustainable maintenance of POI set models, allowing the possibility of selling the same data to customers from different application fields.</p>

<p id="_1c3f72ca-2d6e-6a4d-7cc3-3cbbfde9060b">POI-CM is an open conceptual data model for the storage and exchange of POI models. It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) <link target="https://github.com/ISO-TC211/HMMG">conceptual model standards</link> for spatial and temporal data. Building on the ISO fundation assures that the features described in the POI Models share the same spatial-temporal universe as features described by related standards (e.g., &lt;&lt;citygml,CityGML..).</p>

<p id="_15006433-4441-0c2b-691f-1ab566358186">A POI is not a dataset. Rather, it is a feature type that enhances an existing dataset of features. POI-CM builds on the ISO General Feature Model (<eref type="inline" bibitemid="iso19109" citeas="ISO 19109">ISO 10109</eref>) and the ISO Geometry Model (<eref type="inline" bibitemid="iso19107" citeas="ISO 19107">ISO 19107</eref>). To avoid reinventing things, POI-CM also borrows some classes from ISO Common Data Types (<eref type="inline" bibitemid="iso19103" citeas="ISO 19103">ISO 19103</eref>) and <eref type="inline" bibitemid="citygml" citeas="OGC CityGML 3.0">OGC CityGML 3.0</eref>.</p>

<p id="_2ee0921d-f2d3-e38e-65c8-9d0dbf619cbc">The POI Conceptual Model standard defines the conceptual model in UML and is the focus of this Users Guide. The the future, separate implementation standards can be published for each encoding to be defined. This separation permits generality as well as specificity. The first POI implementation standard will describe the JSON encoding. Other implementation standards (e.g. for relational database schema) are expected to follow.</p>

<p id="_20d38b02-0784-fc66-55d6-06c5ce44a3b4">The POI-CM Standard includes hyperlinks that can be used to navigate directly to relevant sections of the Users Guide.</p>

<p id="_4f4f7fdf-8599-422d-ba1b-1e754ba67497">The OGC POI Conceptual Model Standard specifies the representation of points of interest (POI) models. The POI Conceptual Model is expected to be the basis for a number of future implementation standards in which subsets of the Conceptual Model can be implemented. These future standards will be published separately to enable consistent and efficient storage and exchange of data.</p>

<p id="_6d4a55a7-10a5-957b-0881-b57118c85192">The POI Conceptual Model Standard was designed to be concise and easy to use. As a result, most non-normative content has been removed. The purpose of this Users Guide is to capture that non-normative content and make it easy to access if and when needed.</p>

<clause id="ug_nonstandard_attributes_section" obligation="normative">
<title>Payload: Nonstandard Attributes</title>
<p id="_1eab22c8-1735-c095-9d06-e7fbfb26ebfa">An <em>attribute</em> is a named property of a feature. While this POI Conceptual Model Standard specifies some standard attributes (e.g., lifetime attributes), most applications will need to define and use some attributes that are not normatively defined by the standard. The mechanism for including non-standard attributes in a POI is to use the <strong>POI_Payload</strong> property.</p>

<clause id="_using_poi_payload" obligation="normative">
<title>Using POI_Payload</title>
<p id="_671f4d1e-fd5b-ca9f-6d68-b324887f2da1">A <strong>POI_Payload</strong> is only partially specified in this POI Conceptual Model Standard. These properties are specified:</p>

<dl id="_94b8befc-4924-1ee6-cac9-983709549e1d"><dt>usesSchema</dt>
<dd><p id="_3bc2088c-4b71-a100-1093-5e39060ed276">The value identifies a <em>schema</em> for the payload. How this idenfication is done and what the schema looks like depends on the particular implentation technology used. We’ll see some examples below. The schema describes the <em>syntax</em> for the other properties of the payload, and the value for identifying the schema is typically a <em>URI</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hasDefinition</dt>
<dd><p id="_2aec9f3f-ca9a-b575-f9e0-0c504e9cbbbf">The value is a companion to the schema referenced by <strong>usesSchema</strong>, and it describes the <em>semantics</em> of the various payload fields. Typically this will be plain text descriptions of the properties, what standards they adhere to, etc.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p id="_f3380f85-5c15-2074-4739-b0906a47165b">For example, suppose an application needed an attribute called <strong>isPublic</strong>, whose value is true or false depending on whether or not the POI is something the general public can visit. A particular POI could include a <strong>hasPayload</strong> association to a payload that looks like this in conceptual form:</p>

<table id="_6193f53d-c740-a858-4cd3-2caf5a9c9c7e"><colgroup><col width="16.6666%"/><col width="33.3333%"/><col width="50.0001%"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="left"><strong>Attribute</strong></th>

<p id="_bc847c13-f5f8-382a-1f19-84d77e89e46c">This POI Conceptual Model Standard has an Informative Annex which contains a number of conceptual model fragments taken from other OGC Standards which may be useful and recommended for using in payloads when the corresponding concept needs modeling.

<p id="_04d35976-479e-4e93-b4db-e5082756a4ee">An address is a structured or semi-structured way of expressing where a place on earth can be found, usually referencing political areas, route (street) names, and numbers on routes. These are the things one uses to specify where mail is to be delivered, or packages are to be picked up. Special software called <em>geocoders</em> can convert an addresses into (latitude, longitude) position on earth.</p>

<p id="_c61b7c23-2696-ce0d-5e5a-67af16b97f75">There are many addressing systems in use in the world. A schema to represent them all precisely would be quite complicated.  The recommendation here is to use the <strong>CI_Address</strong> class from the Informative Annex:</p>

The <em>ITU-T E.164 standard</em> (<link target="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164">ref</link>) specifies a suitable format for telephone numbers. It starts with a recommended <strong>+</strong> sign, followed by up to fifteen digits (with no spaces or other punctuation). The digits will typically be a country code, then an area code, then a local number. For example, the US local number 555-1234 with an area code of 212 would be represented by this character string:</p>

<clause id="_opening_hours" obligation="normative">
<title>Opening Hours</title>
<p id="_c048351f-ff5b-60fb-1a03-4ddde9eefd90">The “opening hours” of a POI are the times when the POI is “open for business”, or, more generally just the times at which the general public can visit a POI. There may be more than one open interval on a day (e.g., meal times for a restaurant). Often, opening hours can be different for each day of the week, but are the same week after week. But occasionally POIs have more complicated opening hours (e.g., “closed the first Monday of every month from May to October”). Also, POIs often have special hours for vacations and holidays.</p>

<p id="_6c31a777-724c-8dc4-9478-974bc89b034c">There are several standards to choose from to express business hours. A simple standard, which covers the usual case of weekly hours that repeat, is the Schema.org <strong>openingHours</strong> property (<link target="https://schema.org/openingHours">ref</link>). This standard also assumes that the timezone of the opening hours is clear (presumably, the timezone of the POI in question). An example of opening hours expressed in this format is:</p>

<sourcecode id="_d6a0bc96-0d45-7f17-cbe7-8e935e19e78a" lang="text">
<name>Simple Opening Hours Example</name>
   openingHours: Tu-Fr 9:00-17:00
   openingHours: Sa,Su 9:00-19:00</sourcecode>


<p id="_ef7f99ea-2b33-2903-a133-fd65b3474ba6">A more general standard, which handles non-weekly repeating as well as exceptions for vacations, holidays, etc., is the <em>iCalendar</em> specification (<link target="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5545">RFC 5545</link>), in particular its <em>Calendar Availability</em> component (<link target="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7953">RFC 7953</link>). While one could specify an entire calendar using these standards, the needs of specifying opening hours are served well enough by just giving the Availability part. For example, to specify opening hours in France that one might informally specify as “M: 11am-7:30pm, T-Sat: 10am-7:30pm, Sun: closed; closed Aug 1 — Aug 31”, the value according this this standard would be:</p>

<p id="_28b63de2-8d05-39f3-a0c6-43bfbbb6dd9c">The increased expressability of the Calendar Availability standard comes at the expense of verboseness, so implementers might like a choice between the two standards.</p>

<p id="_30de8617-b9f0-8b3a-f7a4-779d75171ee8">There is no class in the Informative Annex for Opening Hours. A suggested conceptual model for Opening Hours that offers the choice between the above two standards is:</p>

<name>Recommended Opening Hours Schema</name>
    "OpeningHours": {
        "openingHoursLines": "CharacterString" [0..],
        "openingHoursFormat": "OpeningHoursFormatCode" [0..1]
        }</sourcecode>


<p id="_2e2b0538-9dde-03f0-22be-8a44ea3992a3">where <strong>OpeningHoursFormatCode</strong> is a <strong>CodeList</strong> with literals <strong>schemadotorg</strong> and <strong>icalendaravailability</strong>, with the default being <strong>schemadotorg</strong>. Note that while technically the Calendar Availability value is one string, it is inconvenient to deal with such a long value (with line breaks) in JSON, so it is convenient to have the value be a sequence of strings that represent lines to be concatenated together, with line breakes between them, in order to form the actual specification string.  Similarly, the the schema.org format, multiple lines are convenient to be able to represent different weekday ranges that have differing time reanges.</p>

<p id="_101edde8-42ce-e46b-db97-a239b0dccbde">The “Category” of a POI is a word that describes the main purpose, use, or description of the POI. It is a word that would fill in the blank in the statement: “This POI is a _______”. Example categories might be <strong>School</strong> or <strong>Clothing Store</strong>.

<p id="_3b385d57-da62-1363-bd8b-14b7646ddb6a">There are tens of thousands of possible categories, and there is no generally accepted list that this recommendation can confidently point to. Some examples of some standard category lists are:</p>
