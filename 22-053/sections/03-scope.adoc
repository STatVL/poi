This document provides Engineering Guidance on the use of the POI Conceptual Model Standard. 

The OGC POI Conceptual Model Standard specifies the representation of points of interest (POI) models. The POI Conceptual Model is expected to be the basis for a number of future implementation standards in which subsets of the Conceptual Model can be implemented. These future standards will be published separately to enable consistent and efficient storage and exchange of data. 

The POI Conceptual Model Standard was designed to be concise and easy to use. As a result, most non-normative content has been removed. The purpose of this Users Guide is to capture that non-normative content and make it easy to access if and when needed.
