=== POI Publication

*Contributed By:* Koen De Baets

*Motivation:* A diverse group of (governmental) agencies have data that might be of interest to a broad audience. These agencies want to make this data publicly available in a uniform and user friendly way. 

*Summary*

Multiple dataset from different sources, each having its own data model, are mapped and/or geocoded to a single POI-data model. The data model should have a set of generic attributes to minimize impoverishment of the source data. All POIâ€™s from different sources are combined and available to end users as single service.
