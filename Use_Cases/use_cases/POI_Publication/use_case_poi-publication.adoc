=== POI Publication

*Contributed By:* Koen De Baets, Digitaal Vlaanderen (Government of Flanders)

*Motivation:* A diverse group of (governmental) agencies have data that might be of interest to a broad audience (e.g., citizens, visitors, researchers, other agencies). The publisher wants to make this data publicly available in a uniform and user friendly way.

*Summary*
Multiple data sets from different sources, each having its own data model, are mapped and/or geocoded to a single POI data model. The data model should have a set of generic attributes to minimize loosing any richness of the source data. All POIâ€™s from different sources are combined and available to end users as single service.

In addition, services that search data would be able to present to the user a single result after retrieving data from multiple original data sources.
