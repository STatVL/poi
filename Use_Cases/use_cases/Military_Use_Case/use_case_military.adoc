=== Military Use Case

*Contributed By:* Joetta Kreck (AGC) â€“ Joetta.l.kreck@usace.army.mil

*Motivation:*

Use POIs to simplify data collection and use.

*Summary*

POIs are a simplification of a Feature dataset. The selection and population of a POI is mission-specific. There is no standard attribution for a POI Feature. Rather, the POI Feature Type serves as a scafolding which is attributed based on the data available and the needs of the user.
