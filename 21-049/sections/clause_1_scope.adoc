This document describes a data model and #XML# footnote:xml[Are we going to bother with an XML Schema or move straight to JSON?] syntax for representing information about points of interest (POI).

In the most broad terms, a "point of interest" is a location about which information of general interest is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier, or more complex such as a three dimensional model of a building with names in various languages, information about open and closed hours, and a civic address. POI data has many uses including navigation systems, mapping, geocaching, location-based social networking games, and augmented reality browsers.

POI data has traditionally been exchanged in proprietary formats by various transport mechanisms. This specification defines a flexible, lightweight, extensible POI data model. This will enable content publishers to effectively describe and efficiently serve and exchange POI data.

To achieve these goals, this document describes a generic data model that may be instantiated in a variety of serializations, including #XML# footnote:xml[], JSON and RDFfootnote:rdf[Are we going to specify an RDF encoding?].

Here is an example of a simple POI serialized in #XML# footnote:xml[]:
