== Terms and Definitions
This document uses the terms defined in https://portal.ogc.org/public_ogc/directives/directives.php[OGC Policy Directive 49], which is based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Rules for the structure and drafting of International Standards. In particular, the word “shall” (not “must”) is the verb form used to indicate a requirement to be strictly followed to conform to this Standard and OGC documents do not use the equivalent phrases in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

This document also uses terms defined in the OGC Standard for Modular specifications (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3]), also known as the 'ModSpec'. The definitions of terms such as standard, specification, requirement, and conformance test are provided in the ModSpec.

For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

////
[[boundary]]
boundary::

set that represents the limit of an entity

NOTE: _Boundary_ is most commonly used in the context of geometry, where the set is a collection of points or a collection of objects
that represent those points. In other domains, the term is used metaphorically to describe the transition between an entity and the rest of its domain of discourse.

<<ISO19107,clause 4.6>>

[[coordinate]]
coordinate::
sequence of n numbers designating the _position_ of a _point_ in n-dimensional space 

[.source]
<<ISO19111>>
#ISO19111,clause xxxx - get definition clause#

[[coordinate_set]]
coordinate set::
individual parts of a coordinate

[example]
coordinate pair of latitude and longitude values.

[[coordinate_reference_system]]
coordinate reference system::
_coordinate system_ that is related to an object by a _datum_ (<<datum>>)

NOTE: Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference frames.

NOTE: For geodetic and vertical _datums_ (<<datum>>), the object will be the Earth.
In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies.

[.source]
<<ISO19111,clause 3.1.9>>

[[coordinate_system]]
coordinate system::
set of mathematical rules for specifying how _coordinates_ are to be assigned to _points_

[.source]
<<ISO19111,clause 3.1.11>>

[[datum]]
datum::
alt:[reference frame]

parameter or set of parameters that realize the _positions_ of the origin, the scale, and the orientation of a _coordinate system_ (<<coordinate_system>>)

[.source]
<<ISO19111,clause 3.1.15>>

[[geolocation]]
geolocation::
identification of the real world geographic _location_ of an object

[[location]]
location::
particular _place_ or _position_

NOTE: A _location_ identifies a geographic _place_.

NOTE: _Locations_ are physically fixed points, typically on the surface of the Earth, although _locations_ can be relative to other, non-earth centric coordinate reference systems. 

NOTE: _Locations_ can be a single point, a centroid, a minimum bounding rectangle, or a set of vectors. 

NOTE: A _location_ should be persistent over time and does not change. 

NOTE: Multiple _POIs_ may share the same _location_. 

NOTE: When a _POI_ physically moves it is understood to have acquired a new _location_.

[.source]
<<ISO19112,clause 3.1.3>>

[[place]]
place::
semantic description of a _location_

NOTE: A _place_ is a human construct which typically has a coarse level of spatial granularity. 

NOTE: A _place_ is generally a larger scale administrative construct, either informally or formally defined. 

NOTE: A _place_ can be informally or colloquially defined, such as the Home Counties in the United Kingdom and the Bay Area in the United States.

NOTE: _Places_ have spatial relationships; with parents, children, adjacencies and contained by semantics.

NOTE: _Places_ have the same attribute set as _POIs_, although often with differing interpretations based on scale; for example, the address of a _Place_ or its URI might refer to the address of the administrative or governing body of the _place_. 

NOTE: A _place_ typically contains multiple _POIs_ and can also be coterminous with a _POI_. In the former case, a _place_, such as a city or a neighborhood, will contain multiple _POIs_. In the latter case, a _place_ and a _POI_ will occupy the same _position_ and extent, such as in the case of Yellowstone National Park, which is both a _Place_ and a _POI_.

[example]
Countries, states, counties, districts, neighborhoods and postal codes or telephone area codes are all places. 

[[point]]
point::
0-dimensional geometric primitive, representing a _position_ 

[.source]
<<ISO19107>>
#ISO19107,clause xxxx - get definition clause#

[[point_of_interest]]
point of interest::
alt:[POI]

_location_ where one can find a _place_, product or service

NOTE: A _POI_ is typically identified by _name_ rather than by an _address_.

NOTE: A _POI_ is characterized by _type_, which may be used as a _reference point_ or a target in a _location_ based service request.

NOTE: A _POI_ does not exclude the labeling, identification, and tracking of persons and other physical objects that have no permanent location.

[example]
destination of a route; such as, Boston

[[position]]
position::
data type that describes a _point_ or _geometry_ potentially occupied by an object or person

[.source]
<<ISO19133>>
#ISO19133,clause xxxx - get definition clause#

[[route]]
route::
sequence of _links_ and / or partial _links_ that describe a _path_, usually between two _positions_, within a _network_
////
[def from OGC API Routes spec ]
route
sequence of connected segments providing directions to travel between specific _waypoints_

NOTE: This definition doesn’t use the definition from ISO 19134:2007 because of use of terms such as "links" and "network".
