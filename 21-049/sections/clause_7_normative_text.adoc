== POI

A Point of Interest (POI) is a Feature. Therefore, it is important to understand what a POI inherits from the OGC Feature model.

The OGC Feature Model is defined in ISO 19109:2015 Geographic Information - Rules for application schema. A UML model showing applicable portions of the General Feature Model is provided in <<feature_model,Figure 1>>.

The most relevant classes defined by this model are described below:

*FeatureType:* describe

*AnyFeature:* describe

*PropertyType:* describe

*AttributeType:* describe

*SpatialAttributeType:* do we want to restrict GM_Object to just points, lines, and areas?

In this Standard we extend the General Feature Model to support the concept of a Point of Interest.

*AbstractFeature:* The root Feature class for this standard. This class has been borrowed from the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model.

*AbstractFeatureWithLifespan:* Adds temporality to AbstractFeature. This class was copied from the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model.

*AbstractPOI:* The abstract model for a Point of Interest. All POI instances will contain these attributes.

*POI:* A POI instance. This class inherits everything from the AbstractPOI, identifies the associated FeatureOfInterest, then adds attributes from the Feature of Interest.

*FeatureOfInterest:* This is an OGC Feature which has been defined independently from the POI. Conceptually, the purpose of the POI is to provide a user friendly syopsys of this Feature.

*FeatureModel:* The data model for the FeatureOfInterest. This class identifies and describes all of the attributes of the FeatureOfInterest.

*DataRecord:* A collection of data entities, each identified by a field name. This class is being used as a summation of the FeatureModel of the Feature of Interest. It should be populated from the Feature of Interest properties. But the exact means of that population is out of scope for this standard. 

*AbstractDataComponent:* The Abstract root class of all data components in the SWE Common data model. All entities in a DataRecord are descended from AbstractDataComponent. Of the attributes inherited, the definition attribute is of particular interest. This attribute associates a external Web-accessible Definition with each entity. This attribute should be made mandatory for a POI.

*Definition:* A Web-accessible definition for a property of the Feature of Interest as represented in the POI. This could be a simple text definition, an ontology, or any other semantic representation appropriate for the implementing technology. Definitions are derived from the FeatureModel for the Feature of Interest. 

Geometry

The OGC Geometry model is defined in ISO 19107:2003 - Geographic Information - Spatial schema. While there is a new version of this standard, it has not been widely implemented. So the 2003 version has been used in this Standard.

*GM_Object:* Root class for all OGC geometries.

*GM_Point:* The geometric primitive for Points

*GM_LineString:* The geometric primitive for line strings.

*GM_Polygon:* The geometric primitive for areas.
