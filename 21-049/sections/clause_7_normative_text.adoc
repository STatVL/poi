== POI

=== Feature Model

A Point of Interest (POI) is a Feature. Therefore, it is important to understand what a POI inherits from the OGC Feature model.

The OGC Feature Model is defined in ISO 19109:2015 Geographic Information - Rules for application schema. A UML model showing applicable portions of the General Feature Model is provided in <<feature_model,Figure 1>>.

The most relevant classes defined by this model are described below:

*<<FeatureType-section,FeatureType:>>* This class describes how a feature class shall be constructed in an Application Schema. In accordance with the conformance clause of the standard, instances of this class are instanciated as feature classes in an Application Schema

*<<AnyFeature-section,AnyFeature:>>* The class AnyFeature is an instance of the «metaclass» FeatureType (ISO 19109). It represents the set of all classes which are feature types. 

In an implementation this abstract class shall be substituted by a concrete class representing a feature type from an application schema associated with a domain of discourse (ISO 19109, ISO 19101).

*<<AttributeType-section,AttributeType:>>* characteristic of a feature

=== POI Class Model

In this Standard we extend the General Feature Model to support the concept of a Point of Interest.

*<<AbstractFeature-section,AbstractFeature:>>* The root Feature class for this standard. This class has been borrowed from the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model.

*<<AbstractFeatureWithLifespan-section,AbstractFeatureWithLifespan:>>* Adds temporality to AbstractFeature. This class was borrowed from the CityGML 3.0 Conceptual Model.

*<<AbstractPOI-section,AbstractPOI:>>* The abstract model for a Point of Interest. All POI instances will contain these attributes.

*<<POIProperty-section,POIProperty:>>* The abstract model for a Property of a Feature of Interest which is to be represented in a POI.

*POI:* A POI instance. 

*<<FeatureOfInterest-section,FeatureOfInterest:>>* This is an OGC Feature which has been defined independently from the POI. Conceptually, the purpose of the POI is to provide a user friendly synopsys of this Feature.

=== Geometry

The OGC Geometry model is defined in ISO 19107:2003 - Geographic Information - Spatial schema. While there is a new version of this standard, it has not been widely implemented. So the 2003 version has been used in this Standard.

The OGC Geometry Model is calable of representing very complex geometries. Much  more complex than are needed for a POI. Therefore, POI geometries are restricted to Points, lines, and Polygons. <<geometry_model,Figure 2>> provides a UML model of the classes from ISO 19107 which are applicable to POIs.

The key classes desecribed in this figure are:

*<<GM_Object-section,GM_Object:>>* Root class for all OGC geometries.

*<<GM_Point-section,GM_Point:>>* The geometric primitive for Points

*<<GM_LineString-section,GM_LineString:>>* The geometric primitive for line strings.

*<<GM_Polygon-section,GM_Polygon:>>* The geometric primitive for areas.
